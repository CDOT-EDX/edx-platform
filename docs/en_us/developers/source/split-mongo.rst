Split Mongo Modulestore
############################

*Split Mongo* is the term used for the new edX modulestore. Split Mongo is
built on mongoDB. For information about mongoDB, see the `mongoDB website`_.

The "split" in Split Mongo refers to its three-tiered data model that separates
courses, structure, and content. This architecture enables more complex content
management capabilities in the edX Platform.

Split Mongo Data Model
************************

In the Split Mongo data model, edX courses are split into three collections
(right term?):

* 

=============
Course Index
=============

Dictionary of all course_id/branch combos

==========================
Course Structures
==========================

Complete structure of a course

Dictionary of XBlocks.  DAG tree?

References by block_id, generated by edX.

Each XBlock refers to a definition

Each change creates a new structure

==========================
Course Definitions
==========================

Documents that are actual content of each block (e.g., HTML, exercises)
